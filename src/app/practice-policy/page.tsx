The definition of health insurance plan does not include life insurance companies, automobile insurance companies, or workers&#39; compensation carriers. These are not covered under HIPAA. Therefore, if you would like information submitted to one of these companies, an authorization will be required unless otherwise required by state or federal law.</p>
                        <p className="indent-8 mt-3">Communicating with You and Others Involved in Your Care. This practice may contact you to provide appointment reminders or information about treatment alternatives, other health-related benefits, and services that may be of interest to you. In certain situations, we may share information about you with a friend or family member who is involved in your care or payment for your care unless you have requested that such disclosures not occur and we have agreed. The information disclosed will be directly relevant to such person&#39;s involvement with your care or payment related to your care. Whenever possible, this person will be identified by you. However, in emergencies or other situations where you are unable to express your preference, we may need to share information about you with other individuals or organizations to coordinate your care or notify your family.</p>

These activities are necessary for the government to monitor the healthcare system, government programs, and compliance with civil rights laws.

We will not release information without the written authorization of you or your legal representative, or in the instance of issuance. This may also be the case in the example of a court subpoena requiring provision of such information of which you have been appropriately notified and in response to which you have not opposed the court subpoena within the legally specified format and timeframe, or in the instance of the issuance of a court order compelling me to provide Protected Health Information (PHI). This privilege does not apply when you are being evaluated for a third party or where the evaluation is court-ordered. You will be informed in advance if this is the case.

This is especially true of policies purchased by companies outside the state of Connecticut. We cannot verify your coverage as we are not the policyholder. Please make sure your insurance covers telehealth services. You can verify your coverage online or by contacting your insurance company directly. You are required to sign forms in our office, acknowledging that you are responsible for any fees that your insurance company denies. Please verify coverage before your first appointment. All copays, co-insurance, deductibles, and outstanding balances are due upon arrival. You may contact our office with any questions or concerns.</p>
                        <p className="mb-3">As a reminder, if you do not cancel at least 24 hours before your appointment time, all commercial insurance plans will be charged a $100 fee.</p>
